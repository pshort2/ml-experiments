This project is where I am uploading my experiments with machine learning and tools such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Desriptions:
NN: An attempt to build my own neural network from scratch
PyTorch Examples: A folder dedicated projects in which I familiarise myself with PyTorch
Other notebooks: Examples of some simple regression models
